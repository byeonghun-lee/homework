    <p class="text">1984 is about a man called Winston Smith a lower class member of “The Party” which is the government that controls the country. He works in a part called the Ministry of Truth where he works to erase everything from the history books that says anything bad about the party. But he is followed, like everybody by cameras and he isn’t allowed to do some things that he wants like just saying or thinking some words. He becomes frustrated by this and buy’s a diary to record his thoughts. He believes that O’Brien someone in a higher class of the party secretly works for the Brotherhood– an organisation that is trying to overthrow the party. He begins to have a love affair with a woman called Julia (which is illegal according to the party) and then he is told by O’Brien that he hates The Party as well and that he is a member of the brotherhood.</p>
